# Bauzeitenplan (Microsoft Teams)

This project is a Microsoft Teams integration built using React, designed to function as a calendar or planner. It's worth noting that a significant portion of the code is consolidated into a single file. Admittedly, this was one of my early coding endeavors, and my grasp of software architecture may not have been as polished as it is now.

While the codebase may not adhere to the best practices of software architecture, the program functions as intended. Consider this project as a snapshot of my coding journey, capturing the early stages where I was still refining my skills. Despite any architectural shortcomings, the integration successfully serves its purpose.

Feel free to explore the code, and perhaps use it as a reference or starting point for your own projects. Remember, we all start somewhere in our coding journey, and this project is a testament to that learning process. Enjoy exploring the code, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions! ðŸ˜Š
